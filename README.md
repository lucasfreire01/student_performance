# student_performance
Hello, this is a project that has a goal to predict the score of students based on games. We have 18 questions and some sessions, each session must answer each question with the result we can predict the score based on the game played.
The processing method was Xgboost. classifier together Kfold.By the first time, we used xgboost by then we never listen to it but stayed very excited because studying deeper I figured out this is an upgrade of Decision Tree and Random Forest.
For having a precision biggest we use the F1_score taking the predicted value and recall value we arrived at 0.664. That is a competition of Kaggle.com so some insides were taken of other people for example the class split, the generation of features and events, and questions for their respective groups. Almost all the links you need are on the comment of code just the question for their respective group there not is at code, this idea is a  seen project, and the insides used were take-ups of test inference that you can see at the link bellow :
